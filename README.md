# Python-Least-Squares-Regression
Least Squares Regression from Scratch.
Least Squares Regression with Python
This project contains a simple Python script (least_squares.py) that demonstrates the core concept of the least squares component in regression analysis.

The script performs a straightforward linear regression calculation from scratch, without using advanced libraries like scikit-learn or scipy.stats. It focuses on calculating the "least squares component," which is the sum of the squared differences between the observed data and the model's predictions.

Project Structure
least_squares.py: The main Python script that contains the functions for calculating the regression line and the sum of squared errors.

README.md: This file, which explains the project.

.gitignore: A file to tell Git which files to ignore (e.g., Python compiled files).

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

NumPy (for array operations)

You can install NumPy using pip:

pip install numpy

Usage
To run the script and see the demonstration, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

python least_squares.py

The output will show the calculated slope and y-intercept of the best-fit line, along with the final sum of squared errors.

What is the Least Squares Component?
In regression, the "least squares component" is a measure of how well a model fits the data. It's formally known as the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) or Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR).

The fundamental idea is to find a line that minimizes this sum. By squaring the differences, we ensure that both positive and negative errors contribute to the total error, and larger errors are penalized more heavily. This method provides an objective way to determine the "best" possible fit for a linear model.
